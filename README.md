# parallel-IDA-openseespy
This repository provides code for performing incremental dynamic analysis on a structural model using a leader-follower parallel algorithm with OpenSeesPy. It leverages parallel computing to efficiently run numerous simulations, reducing computational time. Ideal for seismic analysis and performance evaluation.
